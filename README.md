# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create two tables by extracting data from our current working tables: one to determine the number of retiring employees with position titles, and the other to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program base upon their start date and their age. Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. 

## Results
The first table that determines the number of retiring employees
The second table that identifies employee who are eligible for the mentorship program

From these tables, we can see that there are four key takeaways:
1.) A majority of the retirees are seniors engieers.
2.) because there is a majority they should priortize hiring them.
3.) Among those that are retiring, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.

## Summary
we can determind with this this we can determind the difference from the retirees and the current employees. then we can figure out whether if we have enough to promote from within or if we need to hire outside Seniors engineers

Next to help this without having muxh trouble is group by age while hiring, then try to keep it evenly distributed so this crisis wouldnt happen
